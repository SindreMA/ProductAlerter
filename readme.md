# ProductAlerter - A dynamic webcrawler for product price tracking

## Description
This is a webcrawler that i made when i tried to buy a new GPU, but they were all sold out.
This app checks x amount of sites for a product and sends a mail and sms when the product is in stock

There are other sites that does this, but i needed to be the first to get notified so i could buy it before others
